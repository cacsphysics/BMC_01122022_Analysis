# Intermittency 
The burstiness of the magnetic field values. 

David gave me advice on how to reduce sample error and that is by combining the sample sizes from a number of shots. The [Figure](https://github.com/cacsphysics/BMC_01122022_Analysis/blob/main/Kurtosis/all_avg_kurt_delay_array_p5.png) here shows the Kurtosis value of the average increments from (dBr, dBt, dBz). This shows that the kurtosis values relax after 10 shots.
