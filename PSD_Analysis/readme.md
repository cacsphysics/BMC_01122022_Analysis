# Notes on the Power Spectral Density Analysis of the magnetic fields.


Computing the power spectral density with respect to frequency is automated. However, the changes to wavenumber spectra are slightly tricky.
This is in part due to the implementation of the hanning window normalization, S1 and S2; [here](https://github.com/dschaffner/BMPL/issues/10).
